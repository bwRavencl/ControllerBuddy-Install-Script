  (*only on Linux*)
- Downloads and installs the latest release of ControllerBuddy
- If missing, creates the following shortcuts in the Start menu:
    - `ControllerBuddy` (launches ControllerBuddy with arguments: `-autostart local -tray`)
    - `Update ControllerBuddy` (performs the same steps as if you would run `InstallControllerBuddy.sh`)
    - `Uninstall ControllerBuddy` (removes ControllerBuddy by launching `InstallControllerBuddy.sh uninstall`)
- Ensures you have the latest version of the official [ControllerBuddy-Profiles](https://github.com/bwRavencl/ControllerBuddy-Profiles) installed into your user's `Documents` folder
- Executes the `Configure.ps1` scripts to configure your applications for usage with the official ControllerBuddy-Profiles
  (*only on Windows*)

  (*only on Windows*)
